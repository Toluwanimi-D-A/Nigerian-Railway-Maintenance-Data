# igerian Railway Maintenance Records (Excel Data Cleaning Project).
A data cleaning project focused on standardizing and correcting a vehicle maintenance dataset from Nigerian Railway operations, using Excel to enhance data quality for future analysis.

# Project Overview
This project involves cleaning and preparing Nigerian Railway vehicle maintenance data using Microsoft Excel. The focus was on correcting errors, addressing missing values, and ensuring consistency across the dataset.

# Objective
To improve dataset integrity and structure for accurate analysis and reporting.

# Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Data validation techniques
- Formula-based cleaning methods

# Data Cleaning Tasks Performed
- Reformatted dates to a consistent structure
- Standardized vehicle make/model naming conventions
- Addressed missing values in service KM and invoice fields
- Removed duplicates and corrected inconsistent entries
- Ensured consistency in workshop names and item descriptions

# Project Structure
/raw-data → Original dataset (uncleaned)
/cleaned-data → Final cleaned version
/documentation → Cleaning steps and notes (Word)

# Outcome
A clean, consistent dataset ready for advanced analysis, reporting, or integration into other data platforms. All inconsistencies were resolved and cleaning steps clearly documented. Documentation includes step-by-step logs of the cleaning process.

# Personal Reflection
This was where I built the foundation of my data skills — Excel taught me to slow down, pay attention to detail, and always question the integrity of the data. It also reminded me that clean data doesn’t just "happen" — it’s crafted. This project made me realize how much I enjoy the process of transforming messy information into something meaningful.
